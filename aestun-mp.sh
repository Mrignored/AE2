#  aestun-mp — multi-protocol (multipath) supervisor for the aestun tunnel
# =============================================================================
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  main.go picks ONE carrier at startup (switch cfg.Transport) and runs it for the
#  life of the process, so a single aestun cannot spread traffic over several
#  protocols. What it CAN do is run several times over, each instance on its own
#  TUN device, port and /30. This supervisor does exactly that and then bonds the
#  instances together at the routing layer:
#
#      application  ->  10.10.0.x  (stable overlay address, never changes)
#                          |
#                   +------+------+------+------+
#                   |      |      |      |      |
#                udp/quic2 udp/dtls tcp/tls  icmp     <- four independent carriers
#                   |      |      |      |      |
#                   +------+------+------+------+
#                          |
#                       peer server
#
#  Applications only ever talk to the overlay address. Which protocol actually
#  carries a packet is this supervisor's decision, and it can change at any moment
#  without the application noticing.
#
#  TWO MODES
#    failover   one carrier at a time, in priority order. The first responsive
#               protocol wins; when it stops answering the next one takes over.
#    multipath  every healthy carrier at once, as a weighted ECMP route. Linux
#               hashes per FLOW (not per packet), so one TCP connection stays on
#               one protocol while concurrent connections spread across all of
#               them. Measured on the live pair: 622 MiB over 16 flows split
#               41/13/32/15 % across quic2/tls/icmp/dtls.
#
#  WHY AN OVERLAY /32 RATHER THAN JUST MOVING THE DEFAULT ROUTE
#  Each carrier has its own /30, so its address dies with it. A separate /32 on
#  lo is the only address that survives a carrier switch, which is what lets an
#  established application keep one destination while the path underneath changes.
#
#  BOTH ENDS MUST AGREE. The path table below is deterministic: given the role
#  (a/b) from /etc/aestun/config.json it derives every port, device and address.
#  Run `aestun-mp.sh setup` on BOTH servers and the two sides match by construction.
#
#  Usage:  aestun-mp.sh <command>          (see `aestun-mp.sh help`)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  THE PROTOCOL TABLE  —  name|transport|obfs|port|tun|a_ip|b_ip|prefixlen
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Four carriers, in failover priority order. Any three satisfy the "at least 3
#  protocols" requirement; all four are independent at the wire level, which is
#  the point — a DPI box that learns to drop one has not learned the others.
#
#  "quic" deliberately keeps the port, device and subnet the single-path install
#  already uses (1376 / tun0 / 10.8.0.0/24), so anything already pointed at
#  10.8.0.2 keeps working after the switch to multipath.
#
#  MTU is forced identical across every carrier (see gen_path_config). Under ECMP
#  the kernel picks a nexthop per flow with no idea that one carrier might fit
#  fewer bytes than another, so a smaller MTU on one path would blackhole exactly
#  the flows hashed onto it — a bug that only shows up under load.
#  A note on the quic carrier's port. It ran on 1376 and was killed there: after ~33 GB on
#  that one flow the pair (1376 -> 1376) stopped passing in BOTH directions, while the SAME
#  destination port from any other source port kept working and the other three carriers were
#  untouched. That is a 5-tuple block, not a port block — measured, 0 packets on 1376->1376
#  against 18 and 15 delivered on 40606->1376 and 48584->1376 in the same window. Moving to a
#  fresh pair restores it; if it recurs, `hop` (§8.3) is the standing answer, at the cost of
#  send-side offload.
