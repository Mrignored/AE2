// Obfuscation layer — presents each carrier datagram as a QUIC v1 short-header packet.
//
// Why this layer exists at all: aestun's payload is already AEAD ciphertext, so there is
// nothing left to gain against *content* inspection — uniform random bytes are the optimum
// and no amount of new framing improves on them. What is still visible is the datagram's
// *shape*, and that is what gets tunnels classified in practice:
//
//   - high entropy starting at byte 0, which no real protocol produces;
//   - a bimodal size distribution (a mass of full-MTU packets plus a cluster of tiny ones);
//   - a perfectly periodic keepalive, which is a clean clock signature.
//
// So this layer does not invent new cryptography. It gives the datagram a header a QUIC
// parser accepts, quantises sizes onto buckets, and lets main.go jitter the keepalive.
//
// Wire format when enabled (13-byte header, one byte more than the bare-nonce format):
//
//	[1 byte flags][8 byte connection ID][4 byte packet number][ciphertext][16 byte tag]
//
// The AEAD nonce is the connection ID followed by the packet number, so the header *is*
// the nonce rather than being prepended to one — the 12 bytes do double duty and the
// overhead versus the unobfuscated format is a single byte.
